MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in .NET compatible programming languages with Connector/NET.

MySQL Connector/NET is a library compatible with .NET Framework and .NET Core, for specific versions see [MySQL Connector/NET Versions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/connector-net-versions.html). The driver is a pure C# implementation of the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the MySQL client library.

From MySQL Connector/NET 8.0, the driver also containt an implementation of [MySQL X DevAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/), an Application Programming Interface for working with [MySQL as a Document Store](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/document-store.html) through CRUD-based, NoSQL operations.
